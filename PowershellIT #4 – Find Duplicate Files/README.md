# PowershellIT #4 â€“ Find Duplicate Files 
## Use Case
Identify identical files(twins) in the folder. Not just with same metadata (file name, author, file size, timestamps) but truly identical files which have the same content.

## Infrastructure Overview

## Proposed solution
Simple and elegant PowerShell function which will accept path to folder where duplicates(twins) should be found. Also a additional(optional) parameter a path to file which should be considered as baseline and identify any of duplicates of it.

### Pseudo code
```

#Find Duplicates within folder
Get List of files in the Directory
Generate hash values for each file
Compare hashes and identify any duplicates

#Find Duplicate of a file within folder
Generate hash value for a BaseFile
Get List of file in the Directory
Generate hash values for each file
Compare baseline hash to Directory files hash values and identify duplicates

```
